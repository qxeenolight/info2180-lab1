        <p>I am an aspiring Computer Science major with an interest in persuing a Digital Media Production minor.
            My hobbies include graphic designing, listening to a wide variety of music and playing video games. In 
            the future I would like to open at least two(2) businesses as well as to receive certification in Veterinary
            Medicine. I look forward to experiencing and passing this course as I enjoy doing Web Development related task.
